# The Protector 2 (2013) Review: A Disappointing Sequel to a Martial Arts Classic
 
The Protector 2 (2013) is the sequel to the 2005 Thai action film The Protector (also known as Tom Yum Goong), which starred Tony Jaa as Kham, a young man who goes on a rampage to rescue his stolen elephants. The first film was a showcase of Jaa's impressive skills in Muay Thai and stunt work, featuring some of the most exhilarating and brutal fight scenes ever put on screen.

Unfortunately, The Protector 2 fails to live up to its predecessor in almost every aspect. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, involving a conspiracy to assassinate a political leader, a rogue agent who wants revenge on Kham, and a gang of mercenaries who are after Kham's elephant. The characters are bland and forgettable, with none of the charisma or charm of the original cast. The dialogue is cheesy and poorly dubbed, with some unintentionally hilarious lines.
 
But the biggest disappointment is the action. While Jaa still displays his amazing physical abilities, the choreography is uninspired and repetitive, relying too much on wire work and CGI. The editing is choppy and confusing, making it hard to follow the movements and impacts. The camera angles are awkward and shaky, obscuring the details and ruining the immersion. The sound effects are over-the-top and unrealistic, sounding like video game noises. The violence is toned down and bloodless, lacking the visceral impact and realism of the first film.
 
The Protector 2 is a letdown for fans of Tony Jaa and martial arts cinema. It is a poorly made and boring sequel that does not do justice to the original. It is not worth watching, even for free.
  
The only redeeming factor of The Protector 2 is the presence of some guest stars from other martial arts films. RZA plays the main villain, a ruthless crime lord who hires the mercenaries to hunt down Kham. He is clearly having fun with his role, hamming it up and delivering some cheesy one-liners. He also gets to fight Jaa in the final showdown, which is mildly entertaining. JeeJa Yanin, who starred in Chocolate (2008) and Raging Phoenix (2009), plays a female fighter who helps Kham along the way. She has a few decent scenes, but her character is underdeveloped and underused. Marrese Crump, who appeared in Undisputed 3: Redemption (2010) and Falcon Rising (2014), plays the rogue agent who has a personal grudge against Kham. He is a formidable opponent for Jaa, matching him in speed and strength. He also has some of the best fights in the film, especially his duel with Yanin.
 
However, these guest stars are not enough to save The Protector 2 from being a disappointment. The film lacks the charm, creativity, and intensity of the first film. It is a generic and bland action flick that does not showcase Jaa's talents or honor his legacy. It is a waste of time and money for anyone who loves martial arts cinema.
  
The Protector 2 is a disappointing sequel to a martial arts classic. It is a poorly made and boring film that does not do justice to Tony Jaa or his fans. It is a film that should be avoided at all costs. It is a film that deserves to be forgotten.
